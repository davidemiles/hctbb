Here Comes the Better Bus

A client for [Here Comes The Bus](https://herecomesthebus.com/) by Synovia Solutions/CalAmp

Everyone is complaining about the app, how it's too slow, how it does not update as often, how it looks bad, so I made my own!

Also, please allow it to use the location permission.

### Hosting it yourself

it's simple

```bash
npm install
PORT=80 node index.js
```
